fastest and easiest way to open a github repository in vscode web


browsing through files in github can be painful sometimes, browsing through files in vscode on the other hand is very easy.


 With the amazing [github1s by conwnet](https://github.com/conwnet/github1s "github1s") you are able to open a repository in vscode web.

 I implemented this feature in a chrome extension, instead of editing the url you are able achieve the same result with the push of a button.
